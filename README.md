# DressingPanel
This panel is mainly used in Roblox Eurovisions. However, anyone can use it for their own use. Feel free to use it, if find any bugs or problems, please create an issue or pull a request. https://rix.dev/projects

## Installation/Use
If you want to use more than one panel, simply duplicate the SurfaceGui which is located in StarterGui, find the `DressingPanel` SurfaceGui and name it for example `DressingPanel2`, then in the Properties, find Adornee, click on it, and you need to find the part where you want to place it. If it doesn't show, change the `Face` to front or whichever works in youe case.

### Refresh Button
When adding the refresh button, which you will find in the repository, make sure you add the `RefreshEvent` into the ReplicatedStorage place, otherwise without this event, the refresh system will be doing a loop and won't be working.

## To-Do
A new system like the avatar style with preview.
